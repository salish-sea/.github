## Welcome aboard! ðŸ‘‹

### Our voyage thus far

Join us in building open source software & sharing open data to help save the endangered orcas that seek salmon along the west coast of North America. Monitoring and visualizing marine ecosystems, starting with the Salish Sea in real time, is at the ðŸ’— heart of our collective collaboration.

Would you like to help save the orcas by creating software that helps monitor, study, and conserve marine species?

The Salish-Sea organisation on Github has a growing number of projects to which you can contribute. We welcome **coders** (front/back end developers, ecologists, oceanographers, acousticians, data scientists) and **designers** (and other *creatives*), as well as project managers, user researchers, mentors, and hardware engineers. Please read and contribute to our growing [SSEMMI wiki](https://github.com/salish-sea/.github/wiki), and then communicate via [salish-sea Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/salish-sea/discussions) (e.g. new projects or repos). Submit Issues within repositories to propose new features or report bugs.
