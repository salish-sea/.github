## Welcome aboard! ðŸ‘‹

### Our voyage thus far

Join us in building open source software here on Github to help save the endangered orcas that seek salmon along the west coast of North America. Monitoring and visualizing the marine ecosystem, including in real-time, and creating software that helps conserve species we risk losing is at the ðŸ’— heart of our collective collaboration.

Would you like to help save the orcas and contribute to open source software? 

The Salish-Sea organisation on Github has a growing number of projects to which you can contribute. We welcome **coders** (front/back end developers, bioacousticians, data scientists) and **designers** (and other *creatives*), as well as project managers, mentors, and hardware engineers. Please communicate via discussion in Github issues including proposing new features and repos.
